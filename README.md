# Air Quality Visualization and Prediction
**Senior Project | University of Jeddah**

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the core Data Engineering and Deep Learning pipeline for my senior project. The goal was to process massive datasets of air quality readings and build a high-precision predictive model using a Stacked Bidirectional LSTM.

I was responsible for 90% of the technical execution, including the architecture design, data cleaning strategy, and feature engineering.

## 🛠️ The Technical Pipeline

* **Data Engineering & Integrity** <br>
The raw dataset consisted of 11.3M+ data points. To ensure model stability, I implemented: <br>
  * Redundancy Reduction: Deduplicated and merged records to extract 1M high-integrity samples, reducing computational noise by 90%. <br>
  * Custom AQI Extraction: Developed a function to simplify complex parameter/unit columns into a single, actionable Air Quality Index. <br>
  * Normalization: Scaled features to prevent weight bias during the training phase.

* **Feature Engineering: Cyclical Encoding** <br>
To capture the periodic nature of time, I transformed temporal data into Sine and Cosine components.
  * **Logic:** This ensures the model recognizes that hour 23 and hour 0 are mathematically adjacent, preventing "cliffs" in time-series learning.

* **Model Architecture** <br>
I built a Stacked Bidirectional LSTM. Processing sequences both forwards and backwards allows the model to capture deep context in pollutant trends.

**Architecture Breakdown:**
  * **Input Layer:** Designed for (Time_Steps, Features). <br>
  * **3-Layer Bidirectional LSTM:** Increasing depth (128 → 64 → 32 units) to extract hierarchical features.
  * **Custom Dropout Schedule:** Implemented a decreasing dropout rate (0.4 → 0.3 → 0.2) to balance heavy early regularization with deep feature extraction. <br>
  * **Output:** Dense layers leading to a single continuous prediction value.

## 📈 Performance & Results
The model was optimized using the **Adam Optimizer** and monitored via **EarlyStopping** to prevent overfitting.
  * **Metric:** Reached a **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.7033**. <br>
  * **Outcome:** The model successfully produced the predictive data used for the final spatial GIS visualizations.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
**Language:** Python <br>
**Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Keras, OS <br>
**Data Volume:** 11.3M+ records <br>

## 💡 Implementation Note
The GIS mapping and final UI were handled by a teammate using the CSV output generated by this pipeline.
